\begin{frame}{encrypted viruses: no signature?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\tt decrypt} is a pretty good signature
    \item still need to a way to disguise that code
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item how about analysis? how does one analyze this?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{encrypted virus: getting the code?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``encrypted'' body 
    \item just running objdump not enough\ldots
    \item instead --- run debugger, set \myemph{breakpoint} after ``decryption''
    \item \myemph{dump decrypted memory} afterwords
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item observation: can even automate this:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item run program in emulator
        \item have emulator look for jump to previously written code
        \item (or jump after certain point, etc.)
        \item example implementation: unipacker (\texttt{https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker})
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
