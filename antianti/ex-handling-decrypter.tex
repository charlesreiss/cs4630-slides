\begin{frame}{exercise: some ideas for handling decrypters?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item thinking of some anti-decrypter strategies for Cascade
    \item which of the following strategies most practical? least practical?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item A. matching patterns of decrypted malware code in memory while executables are running
    \item B. marking executables with too much random-looking data in them
    \item C. matching the decrypter in a normal signature scan
    \item D. trying every possible `key' for decryption on every executable and matching decrypted malware code against it
    \item E. detecting sequence of file operations Cascade makes instead of its code
    \end{itemize}
