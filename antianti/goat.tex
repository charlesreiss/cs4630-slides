    \begin{itemize}
    \item analysis and maybe detection uses \textit{goat files}
    \item ``\myemph{sacrificial goat}'' to get changed by malware
    \item heuristics can avoid simple goat files, e.g.:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item don't infect small programs
        \item don't infect huge programs
        \item don't infect programs with huge amounts of {\tt nop}s
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
