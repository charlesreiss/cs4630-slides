\begin{frame}{exercise: generic detection limits?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item consider strategy of running executable in virtual machine, \\
          waiting until it jumps to code it wrote out \\
          then matching patterns against code it's about to run
    \item which of these would cause problems with this technique?
    \item which are easiest/hardest to workaround?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A. code decrypter and malicious code run at program exit, not startup
    \item B. code decrypter and malicious code run when user clicks button in program, not at startup
    \item C. code decrypter allocates random address to write decrypted code to
    \item D. code decrypter exits (without running malicious code) if processor seems too slow
    \item E. code decrypter decrypts another code decrypter
