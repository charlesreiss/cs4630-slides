\begin{frame}{what about dynamic allocation?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item saw Rust's Vec class --- equivalent to C++ vector/Java ArrayList
    \item idea: Vec wraps a heap allocation of an array
    \item owner of Vec ``owns'' heap allocation
        \begin{itemize}
        \item delete when no owner
        \end{itemize}
    \item also Box class --- wraps heap allocation of a single value
        \begin{itemize}
        \item basically same as Vec except one element
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
