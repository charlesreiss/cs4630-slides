\begin{frame}{other policies Rust supports}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \myemph<2>{RefCell} --- borrowing, but check at runtime, not compile-time
            \begin{itemize}
            \item detect at runtime if used while already used
            \item internally: destructor call when returned object goes out of scope
            \end{itemize}
        \item Weak --- reference-counting, but don't contribute to count
            \begin{itemize}
            \item detect at runtime if used with count = 0
            \end{itemize}
        \item Mutex --- with multicore, enforce one user at a time by waiting
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
