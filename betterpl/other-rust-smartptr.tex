    \begin{itemize}
        \item saw: Rc (reference count), RefCell (track active borrows)
        \item Box --- wrap heap-allocation, free when it goes out of scope
        \item OnceCell --- allow setting value exactly once + unlimited reads after set
        \item Arc --- atomic reference count --- multithread reference count
        \item Mutex --- enforce one thread at a time by waiting
        \item RwLock --- enforce one writer + any number of reads by waiting
        \item \ldots
    \end{itemize}
