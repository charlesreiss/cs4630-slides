\begin{frame}{other things languages can enforce?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item saw: enforcing no use-after-free
    \item lots of coding conventions we might try to enforce:
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item code's runtime does not depend on secret data
        \begin{itemize}
        \item secret data has different type
        \item variable time operations prohibited with secret data
        \end{itemize}
    \item sensitive data not passed to wrong place
        \begin{itemize}
        \item sensitive data has different type
        \item assignment to wrong places is a type error
        \end{itemize}
    \item code has bounded runtime
        \begin{itemize}
        \item langauge prohibits not unbounded loops, recursion, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
