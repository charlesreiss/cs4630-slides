    \begin{itemize}
    \item objects have an single \textbf{owner}
    \item owner can give away ownership permanently
        \begin{itemize}
        \item object is ``moved''
        \end{itemize}
    \item \myemph<1>{owner can let someone borrow object \myemph<2>{\textbf{temporarily}}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item allows us to give away reference to object
        \item track as if object temporarily moved
        \item need to know \myemph<2>{how long object is borrowed forjj}
        \end{itemize}
    \item can borrow object for \myemph<3>{reading \textbf{while others} also \textbf{reading}}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item don't need to force exclusive owner/borrower of object
        \item need to distinguish mutable and immutable borrowing
        \end{itemize}
    \item only \myemph<3>{\textbf{modify}} object when exactly one user
        \begin{itemize}
        \item owner or exclusive borrower
        \end{itemize}
