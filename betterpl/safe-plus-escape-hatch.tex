\begin{frame}{safety rules + escape hatch}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item idea: can avoid out-of-bounds, etc. with safety rules
    \item \ldots but safety rules don't allow us to do some things fast
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item so: have ``escape hatch'' to avoid safety checks in those cases
    \item hope: code that uses escape hatch can be tightly checked
        \begin{itemize}
        \item good target for expensive program analysis
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
