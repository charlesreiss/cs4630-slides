\begin{frame}{exercise: which smart pointer?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Rc, Arc (reference counting, w/ or w/o threading support
    \item RefCell (borrowing, check at runtime)
    \item Weak (reference counting, but don't contribute to count --- works with Rc)
    \item Mutex (with multicore, one-at-a-time by waiting)

    \item say I have flight reservation system with Flight objects that have
        references to Ticket objects and vice-versa, \\
        and Customer objects that have references to Ticket objects and vice-versa?
