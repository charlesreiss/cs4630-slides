\begin{frame}{input as wrong thing pattern}
\begin{itemize}
\item with command injection: input interpreted for wrong purpose
\item supposed to be label/string to match/etc.
\item actually interpreted as part of command
\vspace{.5cm}
\item<2-> same pattern for a bunch of memory vulnerabilities we'll look at
    \begin{itemize}
    \item input supposed be part of buffer
    \item overflow or similar makes part of it interpreted as something else
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
