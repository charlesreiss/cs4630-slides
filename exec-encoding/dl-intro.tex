\begin{frame}{static v. dynamic linking}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item static linking --- linking \myemph{to create executable}
    \item dynamic linking --- linking \myemph{when executable is run}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item<2> conceptually: no difference in how they work
    \item<2> reality --- very different mechanisms
        \begin{itemize}
        \item extra indirection to avoid modifying much code at runtime
        \item change \textit{lookup table} instead of code for library locations
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
