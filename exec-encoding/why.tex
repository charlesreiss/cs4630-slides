\begin{frame}{executable encoding: security issues}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item malware wants to modify executables
        \begin{itemize}
        \item hide in `normal' programs (viruses)
        \item evade program analysis tools by doing weird things
        \end{itemize}
    \item memory vulnerabilities require understanding memory layout
        \begin{itemize}
        \item going from ``write memory address X'' to ``run arbitrary code''
        \item where are pointers to functions (we could change?)
        \item where is code (vulnerabilities might want to execute)
        \item where is data (vulnerabilities might want to read/change)
        \end{itemize}
    \item ways we can load+layout programs that are harder to exploit?
    \end{itemize}
