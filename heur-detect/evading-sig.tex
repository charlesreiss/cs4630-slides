    \begin{itemize}
    \item idea for detecting Vienna:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item signature = code excluding changing part from relocation
        \end{itemize}
    \item exercise 1: what are some \textbf{easy} changes to Vienna
        that would evade this \textbf{strategy for making signatures}?
    \item exercise 2: what are some ways of handling those?
    \end{itemize}
