    % most/least suitable to pattern matching
        % Vienna inserting random number of nops every 8 instructions of virus code
        % Vienna, but replacing code at a random offset in the executable
        % virus code, but with registers for temporaries used chosen at random
        % virus code, but most of the code split into cavities and a "loader" that reforms it placed at a fixed location

\begin{frame}{hard for patterns?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item malware makes modificates to evade pattern matching
    \item exercise: suppose we have a pattern for a Vienna-like virus, and a new version makes the following
        change. Which of the following is going to be easiest/hardest to change the pattern for?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item A. inserting random number of nops every 8 non-nop instructions of virus code
        \item B. replacing code at random offset in executable instead of appending
        \item C. registers used for temporaries in virus code chosen at random each time the virus copies itself
        \item D. instead of appending all the virus code, virus code now split between cavities with a "loader" appended (the "loader" reforms code from the cavities and jumps to them)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
