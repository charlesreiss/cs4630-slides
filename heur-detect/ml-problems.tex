\begin{frame}{machine learning and adversaries}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item I don't like most ML-based approaches to malware detection
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item problem: most machine learning not designed to deal with adversaries
    \item attack: find factors used to ID benign programs
        \begin{itemize}
        \item do all of them as much as possible
        \item inquiry: what might they be in DREBIN case?
        \end{itemize}
    \item attack: provide many malware samples with benign weird behavior
        \begin{itemize}
        \item machine learning uses weird behavior to identify malware
        \item may lower effectiveness on `normal' malware
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
