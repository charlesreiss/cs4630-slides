\begin{frame}{what signature for Vienna?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose we wanted to detect Vienna in execs.
    \item What is best to look for in an exectuable\ldots \\
        in terms of performance? false positives? true positives?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item A. machine code found in example infected file at the end of the executable 
        \item B. machine code found in example infected file at the end of the executable, ignoring parts that change on reinfection
        \item C. portion of virus's machine code that copies itself to a new file anywhere in the executable
        \item D. whether another executable file in same directory changes if we run the executable in a VM
        \item E. for a jump at beginning of the executable to something near the end
        \end{itemize}
