    \begin{itemize}
    \item with trojans/potentially unwanted software, problem is subtle
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item usually unintended consequence of designed-for level of access
        \begin{itemize}
        \item e.g. browser extensions supposed to be able to add content to webpages
        \item e.g. applications you install supposed to be able to change/delete files
        \end{itemize}
    \item not what we'll call a \textit{vulnerability}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item but still a security problem
