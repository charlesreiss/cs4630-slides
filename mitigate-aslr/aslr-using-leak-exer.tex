\begin{itemize}
\item Part 1: What address is most likely leaked by the above?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A. the location of the Foo object allocated on the heap
    \item B. the location of the first entry in Foo's VTable"
    \item C. the location of the first instruction of Foo::Foo() (Foo's compiler-generated constructor)"
    \item D. the location of the stack pointer
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile,label=useLeak2]{exercise: using a leak (2)}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++,style=script]
class Foo { virtual const char *bar() { ... } };
...
Foo *f = new Foo;
char *p = new char[1024];
printf("%s\n", f);
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
\item if leaked value was 0x822003 and in a debugger (with \textbf{different randomization}):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item stack pointer was 0x7ffff000
    \item Foo::bar's address was 0x400000
    \item f's address was 0x900000
    \item f's Vtable's address was 0x403000
    \item a ``gadget'' address from the main executable was 0x401034
    \item a ``gadget'' address from the C library was 0x2aaaa40034
    \item p's address was 0x901000
    \end{itemize}
\item which of the above can I compute based on the leak?
\end{itemize}
