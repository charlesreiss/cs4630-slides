\begin{frame}{entropy exercise}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item suppose we have 32-bit Linux server vulnerable to stack smashing
    \item \ldots but stack address randomized with 256 possible starting locations
        \begin{itemize}
        \item +/- 0x80 in increments of 0x1000
        \end{itemize}
    \item server is automatically restarted after unsuccessful attack
    \item suppose stack layout is 8KB buffer + return address + 12KB other stuff
    \item what should attacker do to maximize chance of success?
    \item about how many tries needed for successful attack?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
