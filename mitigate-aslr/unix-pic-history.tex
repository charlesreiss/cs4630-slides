    \begin{itemize}
    \item position-independent code = code that can be loaded anywhere
        \begin{itemize}
        \item no hard-coded addresses
        \end{itemize}
    \item necessary prerequisite for most of ASLR
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item Unix did this for libraries for non-security reasons
        \begin{itemize}
        \item share memory between multiple programs loading same library
        \item allow programs to load libraries at any location
        \end{itemize}
    \item but not other programs, probably because of overheads
    \end{itemize}
