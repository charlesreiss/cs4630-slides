\begin{frame}{a thought on permissions}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item if we can set memory non-writeable
    \item how about non-executable?
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item we never want to execute things on the stack anyways, right?
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile,label=wxorx]{write XOR execute}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item many names:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \verb|W^X| (write XOR execute)
        \item DEP (Data Execution Prevention)
        \item NX bit (No-eXecute) (hardware support)
        \item XD bit (eXecute Disable) (hardware support)
    \end{itemize}
    \item mark writeable memory as executable
    \item how will users insert their machine code?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item can only code in application + libraries
        \item a problem, right?
        \end{itemize}
