\begin{frame}{hardware support for write XOR execute}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item everywhere today
    \item not historically common
    \item early x86: execute implied by read
    \item NX support added with x86-64 and around 2000 for x86-32
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{deliberate use of writeable code}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item ``just-in-time'' (JIT) compilers
        \begin{itemize}
        \item fast virtual machine/language implementations
        \end{itemize}
    \item some weird GCC features
    \item older ``signals'' on Linux
        \begin{itemize}
        \item OS wrote machine code on stack for program to run
        \end{itemize}
    \item couldn't even disable executable stacks without breaking applications
    \end{itemize}
