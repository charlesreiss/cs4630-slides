    \begin{itemize}
    \item stack canary --- simplest of many \myemph{mitigations}
    \item key idea: detect corruption of return address
    \item assumption: if return address changed, so is adjacent token
    \item assumption: attacker can't learn true value of token
        \begin{itemize}
        \item often possible with memory bug
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item later: workarounds to break these assumptions
    \end{itemize}
