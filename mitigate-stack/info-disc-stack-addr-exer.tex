    \item easlier mentioned ASLR (address space layout randomization)
    \item for stack: choose secret starting address for stack

    \item info disclosure bugs are a big problem for this!

\begin{itemize}
\item Which initial value for \texttt{p} (``left over'' from prior use of register, etc.) would be most useful for figuring out the address of the stack pointer?
\begin{itemize}
\item A. \texttt{p} is an invalid pointer and accessing it will crash the program
\item B. \texttt{p} points to space on the stack that is currently unallocated, but last contained an input buffer
\item C. \texttt{p} points to a struct allocated on the heap
\item D. \texttt{p} points to space on the stack that currently holds a return address
\item E. \texttt{p} points to space on the stack that is currently unallocated, but last contained a pointer to the last used byte of an input buffer on the stack
