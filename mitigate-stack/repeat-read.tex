\begin{frame}[fragile]{repeated reads}
\begin{itemize}
\item sometimes find ``read gadgets''
    \begin{itemize}
    \item example buffer overflow into pointer
    \end{itemize}
\item often reusable (e.g. input in loop in server)
\item can find value with multiple steps
    \begin{itemize}
    \item read global pointer that points in middle of array on stack, then
    \item then read that pointer + 8, pointer + 16, etc. until finding stack canary
    \end{itemize}
\item can leak 8+ bytes with repeated 1-byte leak
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
