\begin{frame}{why doesn't W xor X solve the problem?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item W xor X is ``almost free'', keeps attacker from writing code?
    \item problem: useful machine code is in program already
        \begin{itemize}
        \item just need to find writable function pointer
        \end{itemize}
    \item saw special case: arc injection
        \begin{itemize}
        \item happened to find useful code in existing application/library
        \end{itemize}
    \item turns out: almost always useful code
    \end{itemize}
