BEFORE: reset little webapp

little webapp:
http://localhost:8000/demo/
    - sets a cookie to track my session
    - has session ID
    - associated "dangerous action" count -- I'll get to that later
    - show network log with cookie being sent

http://localhost/xss-demo/demos.html
    - put things in value
    - shows up on web page
    - show source code

    - can also make invisible
    - show network log and open invisible page
    - show source code


---- SOP demo

three frames:
    one file with secret code
        open in seperate window, show source code
    read local secret link *outside of frame* gets its value
        could have sent it to remote server (via loading image, e.g.)

    show source code
        same idea with frame containing collagb
    open error console
        click collab link
        show error

   (can ignore last one, unless asked)
   
---- CJack Demo

preview:
    http://localhost:8000/demo/danger/
    show dangerous action page of webapp we saw before

you can make iframes invisible
    displayed but transparent
    
show source code
    code to position 

mitigation
    show http://localhost:8000/demo/danger-framedeny/
        show HTTP header difference

    mention breaks things like GCal embedding

---- CORS demo

demonstrate the iframe-based read doesn't work -- as before
    
    show good read
    show Access Control Allow header
