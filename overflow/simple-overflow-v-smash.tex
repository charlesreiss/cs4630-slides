    \begin{itemize}
    \item simple overflow seemed like very unusual, specific scenario
        \begin{itemize}
        \item needed important value right next to buffer
        \item needed to be able to set to useful value
        \end{itemize}
    \item stack smashing showed it wasn't:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item always had important pointer (return address)
        \item always had useful value to set it to (pointer to buffer)
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item variation 1: \myemph<3>{other generally useful pointers?}
    \item variation 2: \myemph<2>{other generally useful new values?}
    \end{itemize}
