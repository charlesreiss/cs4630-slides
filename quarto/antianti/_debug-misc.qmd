### unstealthy debuggers 


* is a debugger installed? 

   * unlikely on Windows, maybe ignore those machines

* is a debugger process running (don't check if it's tracing you)

### confusing debuggers  {.smaller}


* ‘‘broken’’ executable formats 

   * e.g., recall ELF: segments and sections
   * corrupt sections --- program still works
   * overlapping segments/sections --- program still works

* use the stack pointer not for the stack 

   * stack trace?
