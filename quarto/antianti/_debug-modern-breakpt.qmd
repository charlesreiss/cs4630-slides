### modern debuggers  {.smaller}


* <code>int 3</code> is the oldest x86 debugging mechanism
* modern x86: 4 ‘‘breakpoint’’ registers (<em>DR0--DR3</em>) 

   * contain address of program instructions
   * need more than 4? probably fallback to <code>int 3</code>

* processor triggers exception when address reached 

   * 4 extra registers + comparators in CPU?

* flag to invoke debugger if debugging registers used 

   * enables nested debugging
