### encrypted viruses: no signature? 


* <code>decrypt</code> is a pretty good signature
* still need to a way to disguise that code 
<hr class="vspace" />
* how about analysis? how does one analyze this?


### encrypted virus: getting the code?  {.smaller}


* ‘‘encrypted’’ body
* just running objdump not enough…
* instead --- run debugger, set <em>breakpoint</em> after ‘‘decryption’’
* <em>dump decrypted memory</em> afterwords 
<hr class="vspace" />
* observation: can even automate this: 

   * run program in emulator
   * have emulator look for jump to previously written code
   * (or jump after certain point, etc.)
   * example implementation: unipacker (<code>https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker</code>)
