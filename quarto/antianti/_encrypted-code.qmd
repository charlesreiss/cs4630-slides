### encrypted(?) viruses

```c
char encrypted[] = "\x12\x45...";
char key[] = "...";
virusEntryPoint() {
    decrypt(encrypted, key);
    goto encrypted;
}
decrypt(char *buffer, char *key) {...}
```

* choose a new key each time!
* not good encryption --- <em>key is there</em>
* sometimes mixed with <em>compression</em>
