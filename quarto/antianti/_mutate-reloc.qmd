### mutation with relocation

* problem: mutations mess up jumps/calls 
   * change were targets of jumps/calls are
* possible solution strategy:
<hr class="vspace" />
* table mapping old to new locations 
   * list of number of bytes generated by each transformation
* list of locations references in original 
   * record relative offset in jump
   * record absolute offset in original



### relocation example 

<!-- FIXME: redo HTML native or similar -->
