### exercise: generic detection limits?  {.smaller}


* consider strategy of running executable in virtual machine, <br> waiting until it jumps to code it wrote out <br> then matching patterns against code it's about to run
* which of these would cause problems with this technique?
* which are easiest/hardest to workaround? 
<hr class="vspace" />  

   * A. code decrypter and malicious code run at program exit, not startup
   * B. code decrypter and malicious code run when user clicks button in program, not at startup
   * C. code decrypter allocates random address to write decrypted code to
   * D. code decrypter exits (without running malicious code) if processor seems too slow
   * E. code decrypter decrypts another code decrypter
