### handling packers 


* easiest way to decrypt self-decrypting code --- run it!
* solution: [virtual machine/emulator/debugger]{.fragment fragment-index=1 .custom .myem-only} in antivirus software


### handling packers with debugger/emulator/VM


* run program in debugger/emulator/VM for a while 
   * one heuristic: until it jumps to written data
* example implementation: unipacker
   * <a href="https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker">https://github.com/unipacker/unipacker</a>
<hr class="vspace" />
* then dump memory to get decrypted machine code
* and/or obtain trace of instructions run


### unneeded steps 


* understanding the "encryption" algorithm 
   * more complex encryption algorithm won't help
* extracting the key and encrypted data 
   * making key less obvious won't help
