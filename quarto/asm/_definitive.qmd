### x86-64 assembly 


* history: AMD constructed 64-bit extension to x86 first 
   * marketing term: AMD64
* Intel first tried a new ISA (Itanium), which failed
* Then Intel copied AMD64 
   * marketing term: EM64T 
      * Extended Memory 64 Technology
   * later marketing term: Intel 64
* both Intel and AMD have manuals --- definitive reference

### example manual page (1) 


![](/asm/example-manual.png){fig-alt="Top of the Intel Instruction set reference page for INC. Includes information about all the forms of the instruction (with different size register, memory operands), how they are encoded (with information about the opcode and how the argument is represented), and what modes (e.g. 32- v 64-bit) they are encoded in."}


### example manual page (2) 


![](/asm/example-manual2.png){fig-alt="Second part of the Intel intsruction set. Includes a text description of the isntruction and its operation, what flags are affected, and what exceptions are possible."}


### instruction listing parts (1)


* opcode --- first part of instruction encoding 

   * yes, variable length
   * ‘‘REX’’???
   * more later (Friday or next week)

* instruction --- Intel assembly skeleton
* `r/m32` = 32-bit memory or register value
* 64-bit mode --- does instruction exist in 64-bit mode?
* compat/leg mode --- in 16-bit/32-bit modes?


### instruction listing parts (2)


* description + operation (later on page) 

   * text and pseudocode description

* flags affected 

   * flags --- used by <code>jne</code>, etc.

* exceptions --- how can OS be called from this? 

   * example: can invalid memory access happen?
