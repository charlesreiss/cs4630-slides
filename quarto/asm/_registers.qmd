### overlapping registers (1)  {.smaller}



* setting 32-bit registers sets <em>whole</em> 64-bit register
* extra bits are always zeroes
 
```
movq $0x123456789abcdef, %rax
    // Intel: MOVABS RAX, 0x123456789abcdef
xor %eax, %eax
// %rax is 0, not 0x1234567800000000
movl $-1, %ebx
    // Intel: MOV EBX, -1
// %rbx is 0xFFFFFFFF, not -1 (0xFFFFF...FFF)
```
 

* 32-bit instructions are often shorter than 64-bit ones, <br> so compilers will prefer <code>mov \$1234, %ecx</code> to <code>mov \$1234, %rcx</code>


### overlapping registers (2) 



* setting <em>8/16-bit registers</em> doesn't change rest of 64-bit register:
 
```
movq $0x12345789abcdef, %rax
movw $0xaaaa, %ax
// %rax is 0x123456789abaaaa
```
