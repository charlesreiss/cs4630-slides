### x86-64 assembly and machine code 


* your assignments will use it
* will have examples with lots of assembly
* x86-64 \\textbf{machine code} will come up


### why asm/machine code?  {.smaller}


* lots of memory-mismanagement vulnerabilities 

   * program memory layout details matter
   * machine code details

* want to detect/analyze malware 

   * won't have luxury of working with source code
   * malware tries to avoid analysis
   * e.g. using weird code no compiler would produce
