### other things languages can enforce?  {.smaller}


* saw: enforcing no use-after-free
* lots of coding conventions we might try to enforce: 
<hr class="vspace" />
* code's runtime does not depend on secret data 

   * secret data has different type
   * variable time operations prohibited with secret data

* sensitive data not passed to wrong place 

   * sensitive data has different type
   * assignment to wrong places is a type error

* code has bounded runtime 

   * langauge prohibits not unbounded loops, recursion, etc.
