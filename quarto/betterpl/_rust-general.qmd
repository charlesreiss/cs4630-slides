### Rust philosophy  {.smaller}


* default rules that only allow ‘safe’ things 

   * no dangling pointers
   * no out-of-bounds accesses

* escape hatch to use ‘‘raw’’ pointers or unchecked libraries
* escape hatch can be used to write useful libraries 

   * e.g. Vector/ArrayList equivalent
   * <em>expose interface that is safe</em>
