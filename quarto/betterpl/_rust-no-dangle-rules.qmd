### rules to stop dangling pointers (2)  {.smaller}


* objects have an single <em>owner</em>
* owner can give away ownership permanently 

   * object is ‘‘moved’’

* [owner can let someone borrow object [<em>temporarily</em>]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only}]{.fragment fragment-index=1 .custom .myem-only} 

   * allows us to give away reference to object
   * track as if object temporarily moved
   * need to know [how long object is borrowed for]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only}

* can borrow object for [reading <em>while others</em> also <em>reading</em>]{.fragment fragment-index=3 .custom .myem-only} 

   * don't need to force exclusive owner/borrower of object
   * need to distinguish mutable and immutable borrowing

* only [<em>modify</em>]{.fragment fragment-index=3 .custom .myem-only} object when exactly one user 

   * owner or exclusive borrower
