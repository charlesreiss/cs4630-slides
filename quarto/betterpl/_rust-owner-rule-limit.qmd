### single owner rule limit  {.smaller .largecode}



* single owner prevents use-after-free, etc.
* … but too limiting in practice
* basically doesn't allow references:
 
```rust
let v = vec![1,2,3];
let x = &v;
// now both x, v reference same vector?
// violates single owner rule!
```
 

* will extend rule to be more flexible with two changes: 

   * borrowing
   * multiple readers, one writer
