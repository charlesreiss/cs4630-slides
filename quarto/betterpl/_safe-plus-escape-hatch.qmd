### safety rules + escape hatch  {.smaller}


* idea: can avoid out-of-bounds, etc. with safety rules
* … but safety rules don't allow us to do some things fast 
<hr class="vspace" />
* so: have ‘‘escape hatch’’ to avoid safety checks in those cases
* hope: code that uses escape hatch can be tightly checked 

   * good target for expensive program analysis
