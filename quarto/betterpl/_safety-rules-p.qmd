### safety rules  {.smaller}


* one set of (very restrictive) rules: 

   * arrays are never accessed via pointers (only via array[X])
   * always check bounds before array access
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* modify C compiler to enforce: 

   * disallow making pointers to an array
   * add bounds check assertion before every array use
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* now: no buffer overflows? 

   * problem 1: way too restrictive
   * problem 2: still other memory problems



### more practical safety rules?  {.smaller}


* rule for avoiding bounds errors in C 

   * always pass around array buffers with size
   * always check size

* Java does this
* but this is essentially a new language! 

   * can't use existing pointer code

* and this is likely slow?
