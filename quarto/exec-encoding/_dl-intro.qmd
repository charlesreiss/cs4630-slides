### static v. dynamic linking  {.smaller}


* static linking --- linking <em>to create executable</em>
* dynamic linking --- linking <em>when executable is run</em> 
<hr class="vspace" />
* conceptually: no difference in how they work
* reality --- very different mechanisms 

   * extra indirection to avoid modifying much code at runtime
   * change <it>lookup table</it> instead of code for library locations
