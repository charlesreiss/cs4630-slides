### memory v. disk 

![](/exec-encoding/texfig/elf-format-memory-v-disk.figure.svg){fig-alt="Diagram showing the contents of (virtual) memory on the right, arranged with higher addresses on top. Inset on the left is a similar subdiagram labeled 'program on disk'. The contents of memory (from the top) read 'used by OS', then an empty region, then 'stack', then an empty region, then 'heap / other dynamic', then 'writable data', then 'code + constants'. The contents of the inset diagram read '.bss (zeroes; not stored)', then '.data', then '.rodata (read-only data)', then '.text (code)', then (in faded text) 'program header'). There are arrows from '.bss' and '.data' to 'writeable data' and from '.rodata' and '.text' to 'code + constants'.}

### ELF (executable and linking format) 



* Linux [ (and some others)]{.my-small} executable/object file format

![](/exec-encoding/texfig/elf-format-elf-executable-and-linking-format.figure.svg){width="100%" fig-alt="'header: machine type, file type, etc.'; 'program header': 'segments' to load (also, some other information); 'segment 1 data'; 'segment 2 data'; ...; 'section header: list of sections (mostly for linker)'"}


### segments versus sections


* note: ELF terminology; may not be true elsewhere!
* sections --- <em>object files</em> [ (and usually executables)]{.my-small}, used by <em>linker</em> 
   * have information on intended purpose
   * linkers combine these to create executables
   * linkers might omit unneeded sections
* segments --- executables, used to actually load program 
   * program loader is <em>dumb</em> --- doesn't know what segments are for
