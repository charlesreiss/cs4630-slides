### segments versus sections?  {.smaller}


* note: ELF terminology; may not be true elsewhere!
* sections --- <em>object files</em> [ (and usually executables)]{.my-small}, used by <em>linker</em> 

   * have information on intended purpose
   * linkers combine these to create executables
   * linkers might omit unneeded sections

* segments --- executables, used to actually load program 

   * program loader is <em>dumb</em> --- doesn't know what segments are for
