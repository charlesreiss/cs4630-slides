In the program on memory, the address 0x4000 is highlighted and 0x2644 bytes and 0x1544 bytes from that are both measured. A shaded box that matches the box from the program on disk is drawn from 0x4000 and 0x1544 bytes onward. Hatchmarks show the additional bytes from 0x1544 to 0x2644 bytes from 0x4000 in the program in memory. Color highlighting shows that the start locations (0x1000 on disk, 0x4000 in memory) match the LOAD directive in the program header."}
