### preview: exploits and dynamic linking  {.smaller}


* later we'll talk about memory error exploits 

   * buffer overflows, etc.

* common goal: convert memory overwrite to running code 

   * bug that ‘‘just’’ allows overwriting memory somewhere
   * easy to cause crashes…
   * but not so easy to do something in particular

* global offset table: function pointers in known location 

   * useful to overwrite in exploits
