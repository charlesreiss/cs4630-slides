### executable encoding: security issues  {.smaller}

* malware wants to modify executables 

   * hide in ‘normal’ programs (viruses)
   * evade program analysis tools by doing weird things

* memory vulnerabilities require understanding memory layout 

   * going from ‘‘write memory address X’’ to ‘‘run arbitrary code’’
   * where are pointers to functions (we could change?)
   * where is code (vulnerabilities might want to execute)
   * where is data (vulnerabilities might want to read/change)

* ways we can load+layout programs that are harder to exploit?
