### avoiding sensitivity: virus patterns  {.smaller}


* recall: things viruses <em>can't easily change!</em>
* example:  

   * inserted jumps to virus codes
   * code in weird parts of executable file
   * code that modifies executables
   * …



### generic generalizing 


* take static parts of virus
* look for <em>distance to match</em>
* e.g. <code>foobarbaz</code> is 2 from <code>fooxaxbaz</code>
* slower than regular-expression-like scanners


### pattern cost  {.smaller}


* constructed by hand? 

   * question: how could we automate?

* false positives? 

   * push + ret really unused?
   * jmp at beginning?
   * what about data bytes?
   * …
