### machine learning and adversaries  {.smaller}


* I don't like most ML-based approaches to malware detection 
<hr class="vspace" />
* success depends a lot on feature extrction (not ML technique)
* most machine learning not designed to deal with adversaries
* attack: find factors used to ID benign programs 
   * do all of them as much as possible
* attack: provide many malware samples with benign weird behavior 
   * machine learning uses weird behavior to identify malware
   * may lower effectiveness on ‘normal’ malware
