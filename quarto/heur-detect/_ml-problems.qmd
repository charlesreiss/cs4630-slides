### machine learning and adversaries  {.smaller}


* I don't like most ML-based approaches to malware detection 
<hr class="vspace" />
* problem: most machine learning not designed to deal with adversaries
* attack: find factors used to ID benign programs 

   * do all of them as much as possible
   * inquiry: what might they be in DREBIN case?

* attack: provide many malware samples with benign weird behavior 

   * machine learning uses weird behavior to identify malware
   * may lower effectiveness on ‘normal’ malware
