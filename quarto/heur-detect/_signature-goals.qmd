### making things hard for the mouse  {.smaller}


* don't want <em>trivial changes</em> to break detection
* want to detect <em>strategies</em> 

   * e.g. require changing relocation logic
   * … not just reordering instructions, adding nops

* need to detect signatures in real time 

   * don't want interrupt user (much)

* want to avoid false positive
* goals: compact, fast to check, reliable, <em>general?</em>
