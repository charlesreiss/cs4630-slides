### tripwire

* open source tool from c. 2000 
   * also company around that tool, but I don't know about it
* "tool for monitoring and alerting on file &amp; directory changes"
* targetted at servers with professional administrators 
<hr class="vspace" />
* setup: run tool, it records state of system/etc. files (e.g. hashes)
* later: run tool, it tells you if anything changed

### tripwire as antimalware software?

* tripwire idea: detect any changes + notify sysadmin about them
<hr class="vspace" />
* what is sysadmin supposed to do with this info? 
* what about normal software updates, etc.?
* can malware hide in files that are supposed to change? 
   * "data" files with other programs, scripts?
   * …
* what if system compromised before setup?
