### tripwire  {.smaller}


* open source tool from c. 2000 

   * also company around that tool, but I don't know about it

* ‘‘tool for monitoring and alerting on file &amp; directory changes’’
* targetted at servers with professional administrators 

* setup: run tool, it records state of system/etc. files (e.g. hashes)
* later: run tool, it tells you if anything changed


### tripwire as antimalware software?  {.smaller}


* tripwire idea: detect any changes
* notify user (administrator) about them 

* what is user supposed to do with this info? 

* what about normal software updates, etc.?
* can malware hide in files that are supposed to change? 

   * ‘‘data’’ files with other programs, scripts?
   * …

* what if system compromised before setup?
