### malware logistics: how? 


* what are they written in?


### malware languages (1)  {.smaller}


* assembly language/machine code 

   * hand-coded or partially hand-coded
 

* vulnerabilities deal with <em>machine code/memory layout</em>
* often better for hiding malware from anti-malware tools


### malware languages (2)  {.smaller}


* high-level scripting languages 

   * fast prototyping
   * maintainability/efficiency not priority
   * sometimes malicious scripts
   * non-machine-code parts can use anything!

* sometimes specialized ‘‘toolkits’’ <br> example: Virus Construction Kit
