### Morris worm mechanisms  {.smaller}



* used vulnerabilities in some versions of: 

   * mail servers (<code>sendmail</code>)
   * user information servers (<code>fingerd</code>)

* also spread using <code>rsh</code>/<code>rexec</code> (predecessor to ssh)
* hid by being called <code>sh</code> (default shell)
* strings obscured slightly in binary
 [Eichin and Rochlis, ‘‘With Microscope and Tweezers: An Analysis of the Internet Virus of November 1998’’]{.mycredit}

### the early Internet 


* pretty homogeneous --- almost all Unix-like systems
* <code>sendmail</code> was ‘‘the’’ email server to run
* most institutions vulnerable


### Morris worm intent versus effect 


* code in viruses tried to avoid ‘‘reinfecting’’ machines
* … but not actually effective
