### non-vulnerabilities? 


* with trojans/potentially unwanted software, problem is subtle 

* usually unintended consequence of designed-for level of access 

   * e.g. browser extensions supposed to be able to add content to webpages
   * e.g. applications you install supposed to be able to change/delete files

* not what we'll call a <it>vulnerability</it>  

   * but still a security problem
