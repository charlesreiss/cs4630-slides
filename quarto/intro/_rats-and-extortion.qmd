    fig-alt="To Catch a Ratter: Monitoring the Behavior of Amatuer DarkComet RAT Operators in the Wild by Fairnholt et al. Abstract--Remote Access Trojans (RATs) give remote attackers interactive control over a compromised machine. Unlike large-scale malware such as botnets, a RAT is controlled individually by a human operator interacting with the compromised machine. Ther versatility of RATs makes them attractive to actors of all levels of sophistication: they've been used for expionage, information theft, voyeurism and extortion." }
