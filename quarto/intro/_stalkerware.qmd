* this class: mostly talking about clearly anti-user software 

   * … and how it tries to be covert
 

* but there are also problems of <it>dual-use</it> software 

   * phone tracking anti-theft software
   * computer remote administration software

* (also problems of intentionally ‘evil’ software masquarding as legit) 

   * (e.g. marketted on ‘‘how to spy on your \rule{1cm.5pt}’’ blog)
   * (e.g. unnecessairily well hidden when installed)

* ideally, prevent ‘‘bad’’ use somehow 

   * phone OS should prevent <it>covert</it> tracking?
   * antimalware software should notice such software?
   * …
