### relocating: Windows  {.smaller}


* Windows will <em>edit code</em> to relocate 

   * not everything uses a GOT-like lookup table

* typically one fixed location per program/library <em>per boot</em> 

   * same address used across all instances of program/library
   * still allows sharing memory

* fixup once per program/library per boot 

   * before ASLR: code could [be pre-relocated]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only} (lower runtime cost)

* Windows + Visual Studio had ‘full’ ASLR by default since 2010


### Windows ASLR limitation 


* same address in all programs --- not very useful against local exploits
