### relocating: Windows  {.smaller}


* Windows supports <em>editing code</em> for relocation at runtime
   * not everything uses a GOT-like lookup table or relative addressing
   * (though library "imports" still use GOT-like table)
* typically one fixed location per program/library <em>per boot</em> 
   * same address used across all instances of program/library
   * allows sharing more memory / avoids redoing relocation work
* fixup once per program/library per boot 
   * before ASLR: code could [be pre-relocated]{.fragment fragment-index=2 .custom .myem-only} (lower runtime cost)
* Windows + Visual Studio had ‘full’ ASLR by default since 2010


### Windows ASLR limitation 


* same address in all programs --- not very useful against local exploits
