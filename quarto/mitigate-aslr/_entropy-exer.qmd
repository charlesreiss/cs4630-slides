### entropy exercise  {.smaller}


* suppose we have 32-bit Linux server vulnerable to stack smashing
* … but stack address randomized with 256 possible starting locations 

   * +/- 0x80 in increments of 0x1000

* server is automatically restarted after unsuccessful attack
* suppose stack layout is 8KB buffer + return address + 12KB other stuff
* what should attacker do to maximize chance of success?
* about how many tries needed for successful attack?
