* Which initial value for <code>p</code> (‘‘left over’’ from prior use of register, etc.) would be  most useful for a later buffer overflow attack? 

   * A. <code>p</code> is an invalid pointer and accessing it will crash the program
   * B. <code>p</code> points to global variable
   * C. <code>p</code> points to space on the stack that is currently unallocated, but last contained an input buffer
   * D. <code>p</code> points to space on the stack that currently holds a return address
