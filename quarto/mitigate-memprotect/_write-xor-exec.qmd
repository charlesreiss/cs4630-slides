### a thought on permissions 

*  shellcode required executable memory
   *  that was modified while progam running
*  how about we set writeable memory non-executable?
   *  we never want to execute stuff on the stack, in globals, etc., right?

### write XOR execute  {.smaller}


* many names: 
   * `W^X` (write XOR execute)
   * DEP (Data Execution Prevention)
   * NX bit (No-eXecute) (hardware support)
   * XD bit (eXecute Disable) (hardware support)
* mark writeable memory as non-executable
* how will users insert their machine code? 
   * can only use code in application + libraries
   * less of a obstacle than it seems ("return to libc")
