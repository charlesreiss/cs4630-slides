### a thought on permissions 


* if we can set memory non-writeable
* how about non-executable? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* we never want to execute things on the stack anyways, right?


### write XOR execute  {.smaller}


* many names: 

   * `W^X` (write XOR execute)
   * DEP (Data Execution Prevention)
   * NX bit (No-eXecute) (hardware support)
   * XD bit (eXecute Disable) (hardware support)

* mark writeable memory as executable
* how will users insert their machine code? 

   * can only code in application + libraries
   * a problem, right?
