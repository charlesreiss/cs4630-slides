### hardware support for write XOR execute 

* everywhere today
* not historically common
* early x86: execute implied by read
* NX support added with x86-64 and around 2000 for x86-32


### deliberate use of writeable code  {.smaller}


* "just-in-time" (JIT) compilers 
   * fast virtual machine/language implementations
* some weird GCC features
   *  (things similar to lambda functions)
* older signals (asynchronous event handling) on Linux 
   * OS wrote machine code on stack for program to run
   * replaced with writing stack frame that returns to system-supplied function
<hr class="vspace"/>
* because of these features, can't always disable executable stacks
   * "STACK" entry in ELF program headers to indicate if application allows non-executable stack
