### hardware support for write XOR execute 


* everywhere today
* not historically common
* early x86: execute implied by read
* NX support added with x86-64 and around 2000 for x86-32


### deliberate use of writeable code  {.smaller}


* ‘‘just-in-time’’ (JIT) compilers 

   * fast virtual machine/language implementations

* some weird GCC features
* older ‘‘signals’’ on Linux 

   * OS wrote machine code on stack for program to run

* couldn't even disable executable stacks without breaking applications
