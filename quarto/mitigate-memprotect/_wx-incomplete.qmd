### why doesn't W xor X solve the problem?  {.smaller}


* W xor X is ‘‘almost free’’, keeps attacker from writing code?
* problem: useful machine code is in program already 

   * just need to find writable function pointer

* saw special case: arc injection 

   * use address of <code>system</code> function to replace <code>strlen</code>
   * idea: find useful code already in application/library

* turns out: almost always useful code 

   * trick: chaining together multiple pieces of machine code
