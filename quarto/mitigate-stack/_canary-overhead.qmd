### stack canary overheads  {.smaller}


* less than 1% runtime if added to ‘‘risky’’ functions 

   * functions with character arrays, etc.

* large overhead if added to all functions 

   * StackGuard paper: 5--20%?

* similar space overheads 
<hr class="vspace" />
* (for typical applications) 

   * could be much worse: tons of ‘risky’ function calls
