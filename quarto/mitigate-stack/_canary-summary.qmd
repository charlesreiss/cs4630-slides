* stack canary --- simplest of many <em>mitigations</em>
* key idea: detect corruption of return address
* assumption: if return address changed, so is adjacent token
* assumption: attacker can't learn true value of token 

   * often possible with memory bug
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* later: workarounds to break these assumptions
