### good choices of canary  {.smaller}


* <em>random</em> --- guessing should not be practical 
   * not always achieved--- sometimes static or only $2^{15}$ possiblities
* GNU libc: canary contains random data and:
<hr class="vspace" />
* leading `\0` (string terminator)
   * printf with `%s` won't print it
   * copying a C-style string won't write it
* a newline 
   * read line functions can't input it
* `\xFF`
   * hard to input?
