* combined with a information leak that can dump arbitrary bytes of memory, <br> which of these exploits would shadow stacks stop…  

   * A. using format string exploit to point stack return address to the ‘system’ function
   * B. using format string exploit to point VTable to the ‘system’ function
   * C. using an unchecked string copy that goes over the end of a stack buffer into the return address and pointing the return address to the ‘system’ function
   * D. using a buffer overflow that overwrites a saved stack pointer value to cause return to use a different address
   * E. using pointer subterfuge to overwrite the GOT entry for ‘printf’ to point to the ‘system’ function
