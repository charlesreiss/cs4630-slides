### aside: "blind" stack smashing {.smaller}

* suppose we have server that restarts after crash
  *  and it has buffer overflow on stack
* attacker can binary search size that triggers crash
  *  likely close (tens of bytes??) to return address location
* if no address randomization, attacker can guess likely range of stack addresses
  *  with large nop sled, it's not a big deal if range is big
  *  if 1000 byte nop sled and 10000 byte stack at standard location, one of about 10 addresses should work
* probably practical to brute-force missing info
  *  if it takes 1 s for server to restart (probably high), try 3600 combinations in an hour
