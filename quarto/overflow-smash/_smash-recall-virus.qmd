```gnuassembler
    /* Linux system call
        write(1, "You have been infected with a virus!\n", 37)
     */
virus:
    movl $1, %eax  // 1 = SYS_write
    movl $1, %edi  // system call first argument = stdout
    leal string(%rip), %esi // system call second argument = string
    movl $37, %edx // system call third argument = length of string
    syscall
    retq
string: 
    .asciz "You have been infected with a virus!\n"
```
