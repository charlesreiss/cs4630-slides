### attacking function pointer tables  {.smaller}


* option 1: overwrite table entry directly 

   * required/easy for Global Offset Table --- fixed location
   * usually not possible for VTables --- read-only memory

* option 2: create table in buffer (big list of pointers to shellcode), point to buffer 

   * useful when table pointer next to buffer
   * (e.g. C++ object on stack next to buffer)

* option 3: find suitable pointer elsewhere 

   * e.g. point to wrong part of vtable to run different function
