* Ghidra converts instructions to this PCode language 

   * describes effects of each instruction for other parts of Ghidra
   * allows ‘easy’ support for ARM, MIPS, …

* function graph we saw using PCode information, probably
* decompiler is basically a PCode to C compiler 

   * does the same kind of optimizations/etc. normal compiler does
   * different output language

* Ghidra has ‘find similar functions’ tool that probably uses this
