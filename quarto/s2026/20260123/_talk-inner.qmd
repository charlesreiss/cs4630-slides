### last time {.smaller}

*  executable format
   *  directives about what to load + start location
   *  dynamic linker "interpreter" in other file
*  linking
    *  symbol table
*  started: reverse engineering tools
    *  finding strings
    *  looking at libraries
    *  mess-ups with missing symbols

### missing piece

*  talked about execution-generation-time linking
*  mentioned dynamic linking had some extra stuff going on
*  saw example last time --- let's do more detail
