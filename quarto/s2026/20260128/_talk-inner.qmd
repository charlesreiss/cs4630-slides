*  x86-64 encoding
   *  ModRM table; SIB bytes
   *  REX prefix
*  Vienna example
   *  simple .COM format executables
   *  append code + add jump at beginning

# virus {visibility="hidden"}


### Vienna: infection outline

* Vienna appends code to infected application 
<hr class="vspace" />
* <em>where does it read the code come from?</em>
* how is code adjusted for new location in the binary?
   * what linker would do
* how does it keep files from getting infinitely long?
