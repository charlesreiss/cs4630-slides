### last time {.smaller}

*  stack smashing pattern
*  overflow into return address
*  place address of part of buffer in return address
*  place machine code ("shellcode") in that part of buffer

*  identifying stack locations
   *  counting from start (if no randomization)
   *  in debugger
*  "nop sled" --- repeated nops
   *  avoid requiring precise location of shellcode
