### static or dynamic  {.smaller}


* taint tracking as static analysis (don't run program) 

   * track values as tainted/not tainted
   * look for <i>possible</i> uses of tainted value
   * will be imprecise (like use-after-free analysis)

* taint tracking as dynamic analysis 

   * modify program to add ‘‘tainted’’ field to every variable
   * make assignment copy that field
   * check tainted field before dangerous call
