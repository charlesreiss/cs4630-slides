### taint tracking for malware analysis  {.smaller}


* mark contents of file as tainted, then ID how used 

   * find out if/how data of file gets to output
   * track tainted accesses to record ‘path’ of file data use

* figure out where network packet data goes 

   * mark input as ‘tainted’
   * identify what functions process packet data
   * see where packet data ends up on disk
 
<hr class="vspace" />
* can ‘tag’ each byte of input differently 

   * identify which bytes of input jump depends
   * identify which bytes of input malicious command came from

* whole-system probably too high overhead to do in realtime
