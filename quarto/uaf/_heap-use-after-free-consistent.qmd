### consistency?  {.smaller}


* how to predict what gets reused? 
<hr class="vspace" />
* use debugger + print out all the addreses 

   * look for duplicates
   * probably fixed number of allocations before duplicate

* allocators like reusing ‘perfectly size’ space 

   * free something + immediately allocate same size

* trigger use-after-free bug lots of times 

   * one of them will match up by accident
