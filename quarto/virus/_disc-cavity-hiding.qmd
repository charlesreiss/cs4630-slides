### detecting cavity hiding?  {.smaller}


* thought for future: detecting cavity hiding? 

* example: filling empty space in header --- what should we look for? 

   * stuff that looks like machine code?
   * validate matches executable data structure?
 

* follow-up: possibility for false positives? 

   * additional executable format features?
   * values that happen to be same as machine code?
