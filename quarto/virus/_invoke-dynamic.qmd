### infecting shared libraries via symbol table edits

![](/virus/texfig/invoke-dynamic-infecting-shared-libraries-via-relocatio.figure.svg){fig-alt="kernel32.dll (an important shared library on Windows) is shown with a symbol table that has an entry for function GetFileAttributesA (a Windows function for getting basic information about a file, like whether or not it is a directory). That symbol table entry points somewhere in the middle of the .dll file.    This is transformed into a version where virus code is appended to the .dll file, and the symbol table entry for GetFileAttributes now points to the virus code."}
