### modern bootloaders --- secure boot 

* ‘‘Secure Boot’’ is a common feature of modern bootloaders
* idea: UEFI/BIOS code checks bootloader code, fails if not okay 
   * requires user intervention to use not-okay code


### Secure Boot and keys


* Secure Boot relies on cryptographic signatures 
   * idea: accept only ‘‘legitimate’’ bootloaders
   * legitimate: known authority vouched for them
* user control of their own systems? 
   * in theory: can add own keys
* what about changing OS instead of bootloader? 
   * bootloader could check cryptographic signature or hash of kernel being loaded
