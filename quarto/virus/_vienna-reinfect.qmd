### Vienna: avoiding reinfection 


* scans through active directories for executables
* ‘‘marks’’ infected executables in <em>file metadata</em> 

   * could have checked for virus code --- but slow



### DOS last-written times  {.smaller}



* 16-bit number for date; 16-bit number for time
 ![](texfig/vienna-reinfect-dos-last-written-times.figure.svg)
 

* Sec/2: 5 bits: range from 0--31 

   * corresponds to 0 to <em>62</em> seconds

* Vienna trick: set infected file times to <em>62</em> seconds
* need to update times anyways --- hide tracks
