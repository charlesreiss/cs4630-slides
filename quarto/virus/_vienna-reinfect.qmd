### Vienna: avoiding reinfection 

* scans through active directories for executables
* "marks" infected executables in <em>file metadata</em> 
   * could have checked for virus code --- but slow

### DOS last-written times

* 16-bit number for date; 16-bit number for time

![](/virus/texfig/vienna-reinfect-dos-last-written-times.figure.svg){width=100% fig-alt="two 16-bit integers; one with Y-1980 in bits 15-9 inclusive, Mon in bits 8-5 and Day in 4-0; another with H in 15-11, Min in 10-5, Sec/2 in 4 to 0"}

* Sec/2: 5 bits: range from 0--31 
   * corresponds to 0 to <em>62</em> seconds
* Vienna trick: set infected file times to <em>62</em> seconds
* need to update times anyways --- hide tracks
