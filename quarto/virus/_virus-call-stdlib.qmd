### virus library calls  {.smaller}


* common for viruses to want to call standard library 
<hr class="vspace" />
* in applications: 

   * just call the stub

* problem: stubs located at different parts of different applications 

   * virus code won't work in every one

* some possible solutions: 

   * hard-code common loaded addresses (hope nothing changes)
   * rewrite standard library function yourself
   * scan linker data structures to find
   * write out new library/executable and run it
