### appending and executable formats  {.smaller}


* COM files are very simple --- no metadata
* modern executable formats have length information to update: 
<hr class="vspace" />
* option 1: add segment (ELF LOAD) to program header 

   * (often a little extra space after program header, due to page-alignment)

* option 2: update last segment of program header 

   * change its size
   * make it executable if it isn't (and often not --- often data)
