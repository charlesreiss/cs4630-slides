    \begin{itemize}
    \item old idea: `reverse debugging'
    \item in addition to \texttt{step}/\texttt{continue}, \\
        debugger could have \texttt{reverse-step}/\texttt{reverse-continue}
    \item typically implemented by recording `trace' of execution
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item some implementations (with varyingly middling performance
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{https://rr-project.org} for x86-64 Linux (needs sysadmin to set some things)
        \item QEMU for full virtual machines (not just one program)
        \item built-in to GDB, but not maintained/possibly broken with modern systems
        \end{itemize}
