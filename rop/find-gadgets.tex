    \begin{itemize}
        \item no, I am not really good at looking at \texttt{objdump} output
        \item tools scan binaries for \textit{gadgets}
        \item one you'll use in upcoming homework
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{gadgets generally}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item bits of machine code that do work, then return or jump
        \item ``chain'' together, by having them jump to each other
        \item most common: find gadget ending with \texttt{ret}
            \begin{itemize}
            \item pops address of next gadget offs tack
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
