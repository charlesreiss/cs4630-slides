    \begin{itemize}
        \item seems like \texttt{ret} is the problem?
            \begin{itemize}
            \item solve by protecting rets (e.g. hardware shadow stack)?
            \end{itemize}
        \item problem: don't actually need \texttt{ret}
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item<2-> just look for gadgets that end in \texttt{call} or \texttt{jmp}
        \item<2-> don't even need to set stack
        \item<2-> harder to find than \texttt{ret}-based gadgets
            \begin{itemize}
            \item but almost always as powerful as ret-based gadgets
            \end{itemize}
