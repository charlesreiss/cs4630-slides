demo script:
- Defined Strings -> YOUR TASK
- Rename found functions
- Find reference
- Rename found function 0x4e1520
- Show GDB:
    b *0x4e1520
    run
    select 1;
    x/s $rsi
    continue

- Find printYourTaskString() call
- Rename var in if (... == 3) condition
- Right-click get references to that var
- Show references:
    - set to 0 at beginning of callsPrintYourTask
    - find next rerference to triggeringVar | 2
    - scroll to top of long function 0x444550 rename it
        doesTriggerOr2
- Show GDB:
    b *0x444550
    run
    x/s $rdi
    continue
    x/s $rdi
    continue
    ...
- Look at switch statement at top of doesTriggerOr2
    know param_1 is part of input
    *param_1 is first char
    rename temp var used after copying *param_1 for switch lookup
    
- Rename + retype (&DAT_00548d60) to byte[256] lookupTable
- Show interesting case is value 0xF:
- Show lookup table --- index 33 = 0xF, 33 = !
- see second condition is param_1[1] (second char) = 0x2a
    - use equates to show *

- switch to WRITE in callsPrintYourTask
    local_9dc = 0x76?

- observe local_9dc pointer passed to doesTriggerOr2
    - search of 0x76, see it goes to set *param_2
    - is case 8
        - note that setting is overriden if temp var from switch lookup
             not '
