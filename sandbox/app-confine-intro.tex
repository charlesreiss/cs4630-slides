\begin{frame}{application confinement}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item confining whole browsers was hard
        \begin{itemize}
            \item we trust them to do a lot of things --- e.g. write arbitrary files
        \end{itemize}
    \item but maybe we can do this for simpler applications?
    \item idea 1: applications send system calls to OS 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item \myemph{limit syscalls} like we limited browser kernel commands
        \item constructing command language ``in reverse''
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
