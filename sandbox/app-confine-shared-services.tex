    \item often programs do operations by talking to ``server'' program
        \begin{itemize}
        \item example: GUI management on Linux (X11 or Wayland), OS X (WindowServer)
        \item example: mixing sound from multiple applications
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \item whole extra set of calls to sanitize
        \begin{itemize}
        \item when to allow ``get keyboard input'' for GUI
        \item when to allow ``get microphone input'' for sound manager
        \item making sure one isn't manipulating wrong program's windows?
        \end{itemize}
    \item also, server programs might have security problems
        \begin{itemize}
        \item common ``sandbox escape''
        \end{itemize}
