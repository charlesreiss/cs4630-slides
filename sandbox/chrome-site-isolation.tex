\begin{frame}{Site Isolation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Chrome since version 67 (desktop)/77 (Mobile) has process per site
\item site $\approx$ registered domain name (example.com, example.co.uk, etc.)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item slightly different than same origin policy
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item complicated to implement:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item single web page can embed content from multiple other sites
        \begin{itemize}
        \item and those other sites can embed content from yet more sites
        \end{itemize}
    \item web page can call services on other websites with ``permission'' of other website
    \item clicking link may or may not requiring switching to new process
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item same separation being prototyped in recent Firefox builds
\end{itemize}
