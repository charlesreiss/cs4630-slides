\begin{frame}{OS X sandboxing}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item OS X (tries to) implement system call filtering
    \item main challenge: what about files?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item user can open a file anywhere --- we expect that to work
        \end{itemize}
    \item<2> OS X solution: OS service displays file-open dialog
        \begin{itemize}
        \item OS knows user really choose a file
        \end{itemize}
    \item<2> application can ask to remember file was chosen previously
    \item<2> not chosen/remembered --- can't access
        \begin{itemize}
        \item requires changes to how applications open files
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
