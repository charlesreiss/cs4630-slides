    \begin{itemize}
    \item seccomp, separate users: program tries to access X, checks if allowed

\begin{frame}{aside: capabilities/ambient authority (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item user permissions --- authority tied to each running program
    \item ``access control lists'' for resources
    \item sometimes called ``ambient authority''
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item alternate model: ``capabilities''
    \item running program has list of things it can access/how
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{aside: capabilities/ambient authority (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item capabilities = program has list of things it can access
    \item most common thing with design: open files
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item used as basis of some operating system designs
        \begin{itemize}
        \item not desktop OSes, but\ldots
        \item Unix/Linux has many things with `flavor' of capabilities
        \end{itemize}
    \item in ``fully'' capability-based OSes also\ldots
        \begin{itemize}
        \item capabilities for accessing non-regular-file resources (processes, directories,
            network ports, \ldots)
        \item way of transferring capabilities between programs (instead of, e.g., filenames/PIDs/etc.)
        \item OS doesn't track user IDs/etc. (though maybe system services do)
        \end{itemize}
