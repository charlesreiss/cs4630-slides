\begin{frame}[fragile,label=practic]{static analysis practicality}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item good at finding some kinds of bugs
        \begin{itemize}
        \item array out-of-bounds probably not one --- complicated tracking needed
        \end{itemize}
    \item excellent for ``bug patterns'' like:
\begin{lstlisting}
struct Foo* foo;
...
foo = malloc(sizeof(struct Bar));
\end{lstlisting}
    \item false positive rates are often 20+\% or more
    \item some tools assume lots of annotations
    \item not limited to C-like languages
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{static analysis tools}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Coverity, Fortify --- commerical static analysis tools
    \item Splint --- unmaintained?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item written by David Evans and his research group in the late 90s/early 00s
        \end{itemize}
    \item FindBugs (Java)
    \item clang-analyzer --- part of Clang compiler
    \item Microsoft's Static Driver Verifier  --- required for Windows drivers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item mostly checks correct usage of Windows APIs
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
