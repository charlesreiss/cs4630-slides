\begin{frame}{high-level abstract interpretation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item going to show a very high-level view of abstract interpretation
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item idea: summarize some values of interest in the program:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item example: pointer to allocated object or pointer to freed object or unknown pointer or both
        \end{itemize}
    \item step through program seeing what values change
    \item for loops, etc.: keep going until values stop changing
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
