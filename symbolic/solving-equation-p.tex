    \begin{itemize}
        \item can generate formula with bounded inputs
        \item can always be solved by trying all possibilities
            \vspace{.5cm}
        \item but actually solving is \myemph{NP-hard (i.e. not generally possible)}
        \item luck: there exists solvers that are \textit{often} good enough
        \item \ldots for small programs
        \item \ldots with lots of additional heuristics to make it work
    \end{itemize}
