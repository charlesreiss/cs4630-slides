\begin{frame}{performance issue with symbolic exec}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item for angr: I've been running with pypy (JIT'ing Python)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (because easier for me to install)
        \item probably means I'm missing a bunch of performance
        \end{itemize}
    \item but more fundamental issues:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item loops with variable iteration count explode number of states
        \item memory accesses explode number of states/condition complexity
        \item conditions sometimes intractable to solve
        \end{itemize}
    \item some heuristics to mitigate
        \begin{itemize}
        \item prune likely less-useful paths
        \item merge identical states reached in different ways
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
