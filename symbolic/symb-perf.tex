\begin{frame}{performance issue with symbolic exec (1)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item for angr: I've been running with pypy (JIT'ing Python)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item (because easier for me to install)
        \item probably means I'm missing a bunch of performance
        \end{itemize}
    \item for bugfinding: something like KLEE probably better
        \begin{itemize}
        \item working from higher-level representation than assembly/machine code
        \item (of course, less useful for reverse engineering)
        \end{itemize}
    \item but more fundamental issues\ldots
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{performance issues with symbolic exec (2)}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item some more fundamental issues:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item loops with variable iteration count explode number of states
        \item memory accesses explode number of states/condition complexity
        \item conditions sometimes intractable to solve
        \end{itemize}
    \item some heuristics to mitigate
        \begin{itemize}
        \item prune likely less-useful paths
        \item merge identical states reached in different ways
        \item keep symbolic inputs as small as possible
        \item replace uninteresting functions with approximations
        \item only symbolically execute `interesting' functions
        \item \ldots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
