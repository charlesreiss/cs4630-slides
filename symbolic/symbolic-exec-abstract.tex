    \begin{itemize}
    \item angr: executing machine code
        \begin{itemize}
        \item works on any existing application
        \item handles programs with mix of many programming languages
        \item allows mixing with ``fast''(ish) emulation
        \item can find issues resulting from reused uninitialized values/etc.
        \item more convenient for building exploits
        \end{itemize}
    \item other systems (exmaple: KLEE): work on `intermediate representation'
        \begin{itemize}
        \item simplifies equations dramatically
        \item idenitfies out-of-bounds/etc. accesses as error typically \\
        (even if it never triggers something exploitable now)
        \item tractable without approximation for much larger programs
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
