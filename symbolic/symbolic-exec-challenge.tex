    \begin{itemize}
        \item \myemph{`solving' a path's conditions}
        \item generating way too many paths
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{equation solving}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item can generate formula with bounded inputs
        \item can always be solved by trying all possibilities
            \vspace{.5cm}
        \item but actually solving is \myemph{NP-hard (i.e. not generally possible)}
        \item luck: there exists solvers that are \textit{often} good enough
        \item \ldots for small programs
        \item \ldots with lots of additional heuristics to make it work

\begin{frame}{way too many paths}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \myemph{loops} mean often really huge number of paths
        \item dealing with array \myemph{accesses}?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item easiest way --- new path for each index
            \end{itemize}
        \item need ways to quickly \myemph{eliminate impossible paths}
        \item won't explore all paths; need to prioritize
        \item can try to similar paths; process together
    \end{itemize}
