\begin{frame}{real symbolic execution}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item not yet used much outside of research
    \item old technique (1970s), but recent resurgence 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item equation solving (`SAT solvers'/`SMT solvers') is now much better
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
\item example usable tools: KLEE, symcc (test case generating)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{KLEE optimizations}
\begin{itemize}
\item lots of optimizations to make search time pratical
\vspace{.5cm}
\item prioritize paths that produce good tests
    \begin{itemize}
    \item try to execute \textit{new code}
    \item try to find new paths new root of tree
    \end{itemize}
\item reuse equation solving results:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item remove irrelevant variables from equation solving queries
        \begin{itemize}
        \item e.g. if (x == 10) doesn't need variables unrelated to x's value
        \end{itemize}
    \item cache of prior queries with ``no solution''
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item results from 1 hour of compute time (from 2008 paper):
    \begin{itemize}
    \item avg. 91\% coverage on Linux coreutils (basic command line tools)
    \item versus developer tests: 68\% covergae
    \item (where coverage = \% lines of code run $\not=$ \% possible paths run)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
