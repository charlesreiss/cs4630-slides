\begin{itemize}
\item if a malware author wanted to defeat this taint checking,
what ideas seem promising for confusing the analysis?
\begin{itemize}
\item A. timing arithmetic operations to see if the machine is unusually slow
\item B. computing the hash of the malware's machine code and comparing it to a known value
\item C. changing \lstinline|x = y| to \\
    \lstinline|switch (x) { case 1: y = 1; break; case 2: ...}|
\item D. changing \lstinline|x = y| to \lstinline|x = z + y; x = x - z;|
\end{itemize}
