    \begin{itemize}
    \item so far: static analysis concerned with control flow
    \item often, we're really worried about how \textit{data} moves
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item many applications:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item does an array index depend on user input?
        \item does an SQL query depend on user input?
        \item does data sent over network depend on phone number?
        \end{itemize}
    \item \ldots
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item can do this \textit{statically} (potential dependencies) \\
         or \textit{dynamically} (actual dependencies as program runs)
    \end{itemize}
