    \begin{itemize}
        \item a lot of attacks --- user data ends up in bad place
        \vspace{.5cm}
        \item one way to diagnose/mitigate --- track flow of user data
        \item one possibility: \textit{dynamic taint tracking}
        \item some values `tainted'
        \item using them to compute other values `taints' them, too
    \end{itemize}
