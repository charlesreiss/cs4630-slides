\begin{frame}{static or dynamic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item taint tracking as static analysis (don't run program)
        \begin{itemize}
        \item track values as tainted/not tainted
        \item look for \textit{possible} uses of tainted value
        \item will be imprecise (like use-after-free analysis)
        \end{itemize}
    \item taint tracking as dynamic analysis
        \begin{itemize}
        \item modify program to add ``tainted'' field to every variable
        \item make assignment copy that field
        \item check tainted field before dangerous call
        \end{itemize}
