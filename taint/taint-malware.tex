\begin{frame}{taint tracking for malware analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item mark contents of file as tainted, then ID how used
    \begin{itemize}
    \item find out if/how data of file gets to output
    \item track tainted accesses to record `path' of file data use
    \end{itemize}
\item figure out where network packet data goes
    \begin{itemize}
    \item mark input as `tainted'
    \item identify what functions process packet data
    \item see where packet data ends up on disk
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{.5cm}
\item can `tag' each byte of input differently
    \begin{itemize}
    \item identify which bytes of input jump depends
    \item identify which bytes of input malicious command came from
    \end{itemize}
\item whole-system probably too high overhead to do in realtime
\end{itemize}
