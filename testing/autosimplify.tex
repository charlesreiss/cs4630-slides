\begin{frame}[fragile,label=covMin]{automatically simplifying test cases}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item same idea as fuzzing
        \item but look for \myemph{same result/coverage}
        \item systematic simplifications:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item try removing every character (one-by-one)
                \item try decrementing every byte
                \item \ldots
            \end{itemize}
        \item keep simplifications that don't change result
        \item AFL uses some of this strategy to help get better `base' tests
            \begin{itemize}
            \item also has tool to do this on a found test
            \item prefers simpler `base' tests
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
