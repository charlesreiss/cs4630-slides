    \begin{itemize}
    \item symbolic execution: try to maximize paths run\ldots
    \item by finding potential paths, solving to run them
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item observation: easy to measure which paths a test case uses
        \begin{itemize}
        \item way, way, way easier than solving eqn to find a case for that path
        \end{itemize}
