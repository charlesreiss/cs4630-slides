    \item Yang et al wrote a random C program generator

        \item ``Finding and Understanding Ubgs in C compilers'' (PLDI 2011)
        \end{itemize}

    \item carefully avoided code with unspecified effects
        \begin{itemize}
        \item most of the work was about doing this
        \end{itemize}
    \item don't need to know what program does: comparing two compilers
        \begin{itemize}
        \item or one compiler with different settings
        \end{itemize}
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item random selection of types, operators, etc.
    \item \ldots instead of just random bytes

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Regher et al (including Yang)'s follow-up work
        \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Test-Case Reduction for C Compiler Bugs'' (PLDI 2012)
        \end{itemize}
    \item take a C program that triggers bug\ldots
    \item try removing things to make it smaller
    \item needed: automated way of checking ``is bug still there''
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item same idea applies to security bugs
        \begin{itemize}
        \item remove as much as possible and get it to still segfault
        \end{itemize}
