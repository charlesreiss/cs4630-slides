    \begin{itemize}
    \item dealing with pointers?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item one method: one path for each valid value of pointer
        \end{itemize}
    \item solving equations?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item NP-hard (boolean satisfiablity) --- not practical in general
        \item ``good enough'' for small enough programs/inputs
        \item \ldots after lots of tricks
        \end{itemize}
    \item how many paths?
        \begin{itemize}
        \item $<100\%$ coverage in practice
        \item small input sizes (limited number of variables)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
