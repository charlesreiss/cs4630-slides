\begin{frame}{easy heap reuse}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item strategy of keeping linked list of free items?
    \item simplest way to write code:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item free() = add to head of list
        \item malloc() = scan from head of list
        \end{itemize}
    \item makes it very easy to predict what will reuse allocation
    \item if different --- less easy, but still likely
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
