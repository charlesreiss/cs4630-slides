\begin{frame}{virus library calls}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item common for viruses to want to call standard library
    \vspace{.5cm}
    \item in applications:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item just call the stub
        \end{itemize}
    \item problem: stubs located at different parts of different applications
        \begin{itemize}
        \item virus code won't work in every one
        \end{itemize}
    \item some possible solutions:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item hard-code common loaded addresses (hope nothing changes)
        \item rewrite standard library function yourself
        \item scan linker data structures to find
        \item write out new library/executable and run it
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
