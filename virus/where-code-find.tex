\begin{frame}{virus: easiest code to find pro/con}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A. replaced executable
        \begin{itemize}
        \item + executable size size change
        \item + could detect write+launch executable
        \item - programs running programs is common (e.g. start browser)
        \item - confused with software updater
        \end{itemize}
    \item B. appended to executable w/o compression
        \begin{itemize}
        \item + executable size change
        \item + unusual segment/section layout
        \item - confused with unusual compilers
        \end{itemize}
    \item C. replaced cavities
        \begin{itemize}
        \item + code outside of segments/sections if virus not careful
        \item + machine code patterns not seen by compilers
        \item - need to search entire exe file
        \item - confused with unusual compilers?
        \end{itemize}
    \item D. replaced bootloader
        \begin{itemize}
        \item + can check versus normal for OS
        \item - need to handle new OS versions, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \item E. new automatically started system program
        \begin{itemize}
        \item + can check versus normal list for OS
        \item - need to handle new OS versions
        \item - lots of legitimate programs may run at startup
        \end{itemize}
