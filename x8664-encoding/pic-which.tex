\begin{frame}{position-independence: which to use?}
\begin{itemize}
\item suppose we're inserting ``evil'' code \\
at changing addresses in executable's memory
\item which of the following do we want absolute encoding for? \\
(i.e. which would absolute encoding be easier than relative)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A. address of a jump from evil code to function at fixed loc in executable
    \item B. address of a jump in a loop in the ``evil'' code
    \item C. address of a string in the ``evil'' code
    \item D. address of a string in the executable
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
